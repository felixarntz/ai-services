# Accessing AI Services in PHP

This section provides some documentation on how to access AI services in PHP. This is relevant for any plugins that would like to generate content via server-side logic.

The canonical entry point to all of the PHP public APIs is the `ai_services()` function in the global namespace, which returns the canonical instance of the [`Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\Services_API` class](../includes/Services/Services_API.php). The concrete usage is best outlined by examples. For illustrative purposes, here is a full example of generating text content using the `google` service:

```php
if ( ai_services()->is_service_available( 'google' ) ) {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( 'google' );
	try {
		$candidates = $service
			->get_model(
				array(
					'feature'      => 'my-test-feature',
					'capabilities' => array( \Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION ),
				)
			)
			->generate_text( 'What can I do with WordPress?' );
	} catch ( Exception $e ) {
		// Handle the exception.
	}
}
```

For more specific examples with explanations, see the following sections.

## Retrieving an available AI service

To use any AI capabilities, you first have to retrieve an available AI service. Which AI services are available depends on the end user, e.g. the site owner. They are free to configure any of the registered AI services with credentials. While many sites will likely only have one AI service configured, some sites may have all services configured (e.g. if the site owner has subscriptions with all of them or if they are free to use).

### Using a specific AI service

You can pass the slug of a specific AI service to the `Services_API::get_available_service()` method. Before doing so, it is recommended to first check whether the service available (i.e. configured by the user with valid credentials), using the `Services_API::is_service_available()` method:

```php
if ( ai_services()->is_service_available( 'google' ) ) {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( 'google' );
	// Do something with the AI service.
}
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the `Services_API::is_service_available()` method, you need to wrap the `Services_API::get_available_service()` in a try catch statement, as it will throw an exception if you try to access a service that is not available:

```php
try {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( 'google' );
} catch ( InvalidArgumentException $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
// Do something with the AI service.
```

### Using any available AI service

For many AI use-cases, relying on different AI services may be feasible. For example, to respond to a simple text prompt, you could use _any_ AI service that supports text generation. If so, it is advised to not require usage of a _specific_ AI service, so that the end user can configure whichever service they prefer and still use the relevant AI functionality you're implementing in your plugin. You can do so by passing arguments to the `Services_API::has_available_services()` and `Services_API::get_available_service()` methods for which capabilities you require for what you intend to do (for example to generate text):

```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability;

$required_capabilities = array( 'capabilities' => array( AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION ) );
if ( ai_services()->has_available_services( $required_capabilities ) ) {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( $required_capabilities );
	// Do something with the AI service.
}
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the `Services_API::has_available_services()` method, you need to wrap the `Services_API::get_available_service()` in a try catch statement, as it will throw an exception if you try to access a service that is not available:

```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability;

try {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( array( 'capabilities' => array( AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION ) ) );
} catch ( InvalidArgumentException $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
// Do something with the AI service.
```

In some instances, you may have a preference for a few specific AI services that work well for your AI use-case - in those cases you can pass multiple slugs, to retrieve whichever one the user has configured:

```php
if ( ai_services()->has_available_services( array( 'slugs' => array( 'google', 'openai' ) ) ) ) {
	$service = ai_services()->get_available_service( array( 'slugs' => array( 'google', 'openai' ) ) );
	// Do something with the AI service.
}
```

## Generating text content using an AI service

Once you have retrieved an AI service, you can use it to get a text response to a prompt. You need to use the `get_model()` method of the service to get an instance of the model (at a minimum passing a unique "feature" identifier, and optionally custom configuration), and afterwards call the `generate_text()` method of the model. This method will only be available if the service implements the "text_generation" capability - which all built-in services do, but there may be further custom AI services registered some of which may only support other capabilities such as "image_generation".

The recommended way to refer to any AI capabilities is by using the available constants on the `Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability` class.

### Using the preferred model for certain capabilities

Here is an example of how to generate the response to a simple prompt, using the preferred model for text generation. Assume that the `$service` variable contains an available service instance that supports `AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION` (e.g. based on the previous examples):

```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability;

try {
	$candidates = $service
		->get_model(
			array(
				'feature'      => 'my-test-feature',
				'capabilities' => array( AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION ),
			)
		)
		->generate_text( 'What can I do with WordPress?' );
} catch ( Exception $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
```

### Using a custom model

You can also select a specific model from a service. Of course the available models differ per service, so if you intend to do use a custom model, you will need to handle this per service. If the service instance used may be from different service, you can use the `get_service_slug()` method of the service to determine its slug. In this example, let's assume the `$service` variable contains one of the `google` or `openai` services:

```php
if( $service->get_service_slug() === 'openai' ) {
	$model = 'gpt-4o';
} else {
	$model = 'gemini-1.5-pro';
}
try {
	$candidates = $service
		->get_model(
			array(
				'feature' => 'my-test-feature',
				'model'   => $model,
			)
		)
		->generate_text( 'What can I do with WordPress?' );
} catch ( Exception $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
```

Note: Alongside the model key in the array, you may pass other configuration arguments supported by models of the respective service.

### Sending multimodal prompts

As mentioned in the [introduction section about sending data to AI services](./Introduction-to-AI-Services.md#sending-data-to-AI-services), passing a string to the `generate_text()` method is effectively just a shorthand syntax for the more elaborate content format. To pass more elaborate content as a prompt, you can use instances of the [`Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Content` class](../includes/Services/API/Types/Content.php) or the [`Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Parts` class](../includes/Services/API/Types/Parts.php). For example, if the AI service supports multimodal content, you can ask it to describe a provided image:

```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability;
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\Content_Role;
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Content;
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Parts;

$parts = new Parts();
$parts->add_text_part( 'Briefly describe what is displayed in the following image using a single sentence.' );
$parts->add_file_data_part( 'image/jpeg', 'https://example.com/image.jpg' );
$content = new Content( Content_Role::USER, $parts );
try {
	$candidates = $service
		->get_model(
			array(
				'feature'      => 'my-test-feature',
				'capabilities' => array(
					AI_Capability::MULTIMODAL_INPUT,
					AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION,
				),
			)
		)
		->generate_text( $content );
} catch ( Exception $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
```

You can also pass an array of content objects. In this case, this will be interpreted as the history including previous message exchanges from the same chat.

### Processing responses

The `generate_text()` model method returns an instance of the [`Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Candidates` class](../includes/Services/API/Types/Candidates.php) which is an iterable object that contains the alternative response candidates - usually just one, but depending on the prompt and configuration there may be multiple alternatives.

Every candidate in the list is an instance of the [`Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Candidate` class](../includes/Services/API/Types/Candidate.php), which allows you to access its actual content as well as metadata about the particular response candidate.

For example, you can use code as follows to retrieve the text content of the first candidate.

```php
$text = '';
foreach ( $candidates->get( 0 )->get_content()->get_parts() as $part ) {
	if ( $part instanceof \Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Types\Parts\Text_Part ) {
		if ( $text !== '' ) {
			$text .= "\n\n";
		}
		$text .= $part->get_text();
	}
}
```

This code example realistically should work in 99% of use-cases. However, there may be a scenario where the first candidate only contains non-text content. In that case the code example above would result in an empty string. Therefore, technically speaking it is the safest approach to first find a candidate that has any text content.

As this can be tedious, the AI Services API provides a class with static helper methods to make it extremely simple. You can access the helper methods via the `Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Helpers` class.

The following example shows how you can accomplish the above in a safer, yet simpler way:
```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Helpers;

$text = Helpers::get_text_from_contents(
	Helpers::get_candidate_contents( $candidates )
);
```

### Streaming text responses

Alternatively to using the `generate_text()` method, you can use the `stream_generate_text()` method so that the response is streamed. This can help provide more immediate feedback to the user, since chunks with partial response candidates will be available iteratively while the model still processes the remainder of the response. In other words, you can print the text from these chunks right away, so that it almost looks as if the generative AI model was typing it. Especially for prompts that expect a larger response (e.g. more than one paragraph), streaming the response can have major benefits on user experience.

The `stream_generate_text()` method takes the same parameters as the `generate_text()` method. Instead of returning the final candidates instance though, it returns a generator that yields the partial candidates chunks. This generator can be used to iterate over the chunks as they arrive.

The following example shows how you could use streaming:

```php
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Enums\AI_Capability;
use Felix_Arntz\AI_Services\Services\API\Helpers;

try {
	$candidates_generator = $service
		->get_model(
			array(
				'feature'      => 'my-test-feature',
				'capabilities' => array( AI_Capability::TEXT_GENERATION ),
			)
		)
		->stream_generate_text( 'What can I do with WordPress?' );

	foreach ( $candidates_generator as $candidates ) {
		$text = Helpers::get_text_from_contents(
			Helpers::get_candidate_contents( $candidates )
		);

		echo $text;
	}
} catch ( Exception $e ) {
	// Handle the exception.
}
```

It's worth noting that streaming is likely more useful in JavaScript than in PHP, since in PHP there are typically no opportunities to print the iterative responses to the user as they come in. That said, streaming can certainly have value in PHP as well: It is for example used in the plugin's WP-CLI command.
